			<p className='text'>
				My coding journey began in 2013 during my pursuit of a master's
				in disease prevention . Initially drawn to medical science, my
				perspective shifted dramatically when I delved into R and Python
				for data analysis. Block by block, I found myself captivated by
				the world of computer science, ultimately leading me to switch
				career paths.
			</p>
			<p className='text'>
				What I love about computer science is the vibrant community and
				the spirit of resource-sharing. Unlike life science, where
				experimentation and research can be costly, computer science
				offers a wealth of freely accessible tools and knowledge. While
				there are still expenses involved in learning and practicing
				computer science, the abundance of resources has contributed to
				its rapid growth.
			</p>{' '}
			<p className='text'>
				I am driven by the endless possibilities that computer science
				presents and the ability to create, innovate, and problem-solve.
				Through continuous learning and staying at the forefront of
				technology, I strive to make a meaningful impact in the digital
				landscape.
			</p>
			<p className='text'>
				I have experience working on various projects, including
				government applications, startups, small business standalone
				applications, freelancing, full-time jobs, and pro bono
				services.
